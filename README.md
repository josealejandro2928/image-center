# NgpImagePicker

Angular library based on angular material components for the selection, edition and compression of images in png, jpeg, webp formats
This library was generated with Angular CLI version 10.0.0.

### Description

In many projects it is of interest to upload images for a backend, and sometimes we have to consult other programs for the compression of images and the change of format to improve the performance of the page. With `NgpImagePicker` this is possible in real time with for each image that you want to upload.

### Installation

```sh
npm i ngp-image-picker --save
```

`NgpImagePicker` requires [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started/).
For angular version 8 or higher projects

```sh
ng add @angular/material
```

Importing the BrowserAnimationsModule into your application enables Angular's animation system. Declining this will disable most of Angular Material's animations.

### External Resource

`NgpImagePicker`, for use the functionality of cropping images, the ResizeObserver api is used
The ResizeObserver interface reports changes to the dimensions of an Element's content or border box, or the bounding box of an SVGElement.
Install the package

```sh
npm i resize-observer --save
```

### Usages

You must import the module `NgpImagePicker` where you will use it and use the component

```typescript
***
import { NgpImagePickerModule } from 'ngp-image-picker';
@NgModule({
  ***
  imports: [
    NgpImagePickerModule,
  ],
****
})
```

In your component:

```html
<ngp-image-picker [_config]="imagePickerConf" ($imageChanged)="onImageChange($event)"></ngp-image-picker>
```

In .ts file

```typescript
export class ExampleComponent {
  imagePickerConf: ImagePickerConf = {
    borderRadius: '4px',
    language: 'en',
    width: '320px',
    height: '240px',
  };
}
```

### Here is an example with different configurations

```typescript
export class ExampleComponent {
  config1: ImagePickerConf = {
    borderRadius: '16px',
    language: 'en',
  };
  config2: ImagePickerConf = {
    borderRadius: '50%',
    language: 'es',
    width: '200px',
    height: '200px',
  };
  config3: ImagePickerConf = {
    borderRadius: '4px',
    language: 'en',
  };
  initialImage = 'https://havanatursa.com/assets/images/carousel/Hoteles.webp';
}
```

```html
<h2>Basic ussage</h2>
<ngp-image-picker [_config]="config1"></ngp-image-picker>
<br />
<h2>Custom comfig</h2>
<ngp-image-picker [_config]="config2"></ngp-image-picker>
<br />
<h2>Initial Image</h2>
<ngp-image-picker [_imageSrc]="initialImage" ($imageChanged)="onImageChanged($event)" [_config]="config3">
</ngp-image-picker>
```

### More about the component

The `NgpImagePicker` component has a setting to change the width and length of the loaded image. In addition to the language (only 'es' and 'en'). It also has an initial compression option that by default is true. The interface looks like this:

```typescript
export interface ImagePickerConf {
  width?: string;
  height?: string;
  borderRadius?: string;
  compressInitial?: boolean;
  language?: string;
}
```

### Editing panel

Once you have selected an image, three buttons are enabled below the image:
1- load a new image.
2-Open the editing panel.
3-Download the image.

In the edit panel, you can change the quality ratio to compress the file size (in kb). Also changing width and height in px keeping aspect ratio or not, is selectable. You can change the image format as you wish, the options are 'png', 'webp','jpeg'. The 'Png' format is not affected by changing the quality ratio.
